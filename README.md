# HR-Analytics---Predict-Employee-Attrition

This project uses Python and machine learning to predict which employees are most likely to leave an organization and to understand why. A logistic regression model was trained on HR data that includes information like overtime status, job satisfaction, tenure, and marital status. To make the modelâ€™s predictions more transparent, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to show how each factor contributes to the likelihood of attrition.

In addition, a Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the data and insights interactively, making it easier for HR teams and decision-makers to explore trends and identify key areas to improve employee retention.

Key Features:

  * Data preprocessing and encoding of categorical variables

  * Logistic regression model training and evaluation

  * SHAP-based interpretability with clear visualizations
